This is my config for Helix editor.

To get started, you need to install servers for various languages.

Run the following commands to add language support:
```
npm i -g @astrojs/language-server

npm i -g bash-language-server

npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted

brew install marksman

npm i -g svelte-language-server

npm i -g typescript-svelte-plugin

npm i -g @tailwindcss/language-server

npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server

npm i -g @vue/language-server

npm i -g prettier

npm i -g yaml-language-server@next
```

Note that tailwind requires additional configuration.

Note that there are additional configurations available for Markdown.

Note that Vue requires additional config.

At time of writing, xml was annoying to configure.
